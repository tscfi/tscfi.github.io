## rants

This is a collection of various rants I've gone on and arguments I may (or may not) have had. 

It's convenient for me to have this website so that I don't have to waste my time reading off the same points over and over again.

Here are some rants/arguments:

* [trump](https://tscfi.github.io/trump)
* [computers and music](https://tscfi.github.io/computerMusic)
* [teleportation](https://tscfi.github.io/teleportation)
